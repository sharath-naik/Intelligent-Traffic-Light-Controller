Intelligent-Traffic-Light-Controller
A traffic light system based on Atmega 32 micro-controller which was designed to control the traffic lights along a main road connected by side roads.
The program was such that the traffic light duration at each intersection depended on the density of vehicles waiting.
Priority was given to traffic moving along the main roads than to those moving to/from the cross roads.
